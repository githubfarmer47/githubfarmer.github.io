<p>As a veteran teacher, I have always instructed my students to tackle their most challenging tasks mentally, the sharpest. Lesson learned, maybe not. I’ve started and stopped the Atom project at least four different times, and I guess I’m not mentally sharp. I was close to bartering lunch and detention duty with the business tech teacher down the hall for some coding help but decided to get crushed on my own.</p>
