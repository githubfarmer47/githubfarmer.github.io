          <h3>The Most Difficult Class</h3>
      <p class="thicker">Or at Least I Think So.</p>  
            <p style="color:red">I believe this assignment has been the most challenging assignment of the program.  Without question, learning a new skill in an unfamiliar language is well outside my comfort zone. I had difficulty figuring out the tools found on the Atom platform. Ultimately, I had to seek help from a faculty member. They helped me get set up on Github. I found the Github platform to be a little more user-friendly. </p>
